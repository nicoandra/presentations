## TCP SYN-Flood Distributed Denial of Service attack
### Theory

The TCP SYN-Flood attack exploits the TCP 3-way handshake mechanism.

* Attacker sends a SYN.
* The server allocates memory to handle a new TCP connection.
* The server replies with a SYN-ACK and waits for an ACK from the client.
* ...and waits.
* ...and waits.
* While the server waits, the attacker sends a new SYN.
* The server replies with a SYN-ACK...

## TCP SYN-ACK Distributed Denial of Service attack
### Affected components
* The server resources are exhausted because too much memory is allocated for an excessive amount of time, to handle connections that won't ever be established.
* The server commits too much!

---

## TCP SYN-ACK Distributed Denial of Service attack
### Mitigation techniques

1. Reduce the amount of memory allocated for a possible upcoming connection
  * Allocate 16 bytes during the SYN
  * Allocate more memory when the ACK is received

2. Reduce the server's time-window for the ACK, so if memory is allocated, at least it is not wasted for too long.
